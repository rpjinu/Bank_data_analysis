## Bank_data_analysis
##Bank Dataset Analysis and Visualization
#Project Overview
This project involves the analysis and visualization of a bank dataset using Python. The dataset includes various attributes related to customers and their banking activities. The primary goal of this project is to derive insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize these findings using Python libraries.

#Usage
To perform the analysis and visualize the data, you can either run the provided Jupyter notebook or execute the scripts directly.

Running Jupyter Notebook
Navigate to the notebooks directory and start Jupyter Notebook:

bash\
Copy code\
cd notebooks\
jupyter notebook\

Running Scripts\
You can also run the analysis and visualization scripts directly:

bash\
Copy code\
python scripts/data_analysis.py\
python scripts/visualizations.py\
Analysis and Visualizations\
The project includes the following analyses and visualizations:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.\
Descriptive Statistics: Summarizing the main characteristics of the dataset.\
Correlation Analysis: Identifying relationships between variables.\
Univariate Analysis: Analyzing individual variables using histograms, bar plots, etc.\
Bivariate Analysis: Analyzing relationships between pairs of variables using scatter plots, box plots, etc.\
Multivariate Analysis: Analyzing interactions between multiple variables.\
Example Visualizations\
Count plots of categorical variables\
Histograms of numerical variables\
Heatmaps showing correlations\
Box plots comparing distributions across different categories\
